	<h2>Interview</h2>

		<strong><p>What is you name?</p></strong>
		<em><p>My name is Claire Holmes.</p></em>

		<strong><p>What can you tell us about the town you live in?</p></strong>
		<em><p>Oh, Hunts Burrow is a nice enough town, people here look out for each other when they can. I was born and raised here and while there are...problems, they are minor ones compared to the rest of the world. Books...sadly being that problem. Other than that, everyone in town seems to get along fine.</p><p class="hidden">Sometimes...</p></em>

		<strong><p>What do you do for a living?</p></strong>
		<em><p>Funnily enough, I work at the local library. It wasn't easy to get the job, I'll admit. They require you to fill out many forms that amounts to you agreeing to report if...certain books come into circulation or if you suspect someone in town has a book they shouldn't have. Then they also have to check you to make sure you don't have any banned books in your home. Unfortunetly, having the last name 'Holmes' did make the process difficult, but it was about, I think, two months before I was hired. So far, it has been peaceful, so that's good.</p> <p>Well, except for the unannounced book checks by the town guard, but that's policy, I suppose.</p></em>

		<strong><p>Why are Sherlock Books banned from Hunts Burrow?</p></strong>
		<em><p>Oh, going for the hard question? Well, it's...well, the reason is more or less lost to time. The law about Sherlock books being banned has been around since our town's founding. According to the town archives, the mayor at the time, Mayor Canon, had one day came back from a trip outside of town and within the week, all the books with Sherlock remotely in it, were banned. Books that only had brief mentions of his catchphrase or a mention were doctored. Years have passed, but every mayor has no reason to lift the ban and no one votes for it. So, no Sherlock books in town. But, we do have a wide range of mystery books if a good mystery tickles your fancy.</p><p class="hidden">Though...if you do want to read about Sherlock Adventures...drop by the library tonight.</p></em>
