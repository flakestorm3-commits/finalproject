		<strong><p>What is you name?</p></strong>
		<em><p>My name is Claire Holmes.</p></em>

		<strong><p>What can you tell us about the town you live in?</p></strong>
		<em><p>Oh, Hunts Burrow is a nice enough town, people here look out for each other when they can. I was born and raised here and while there are...problems, they are minor ones compared to the rest of the world. Books...sadly being that problem. Other than that, everyone in town seems to get along fine.</p><p class="hidden">Sometimes...</p></em>

		<strong><p>What do you do for a living?</p></strong>
		<em><p>Funnily enough, I work at the local library. It wasn't easy to get the job, I'll admit. They require you to fill out many forms that amounts to you agreeing to report if...certain books come into circulation or if you suspect someone in town has a book they shouldn't have. Then they also have to check you to make sure you don't have any banned books in your home. Unfortunetly, having the last name 'Holmes' did make the process difficult, but it was about, I think, two months before I was hired. So far, it has been peaceful, so that's good.</p> <p>Well, except for the unannounced book checks by the town guard, but that's policy, I suppose.</p></em>
