			<h2>Burrows Library</h2>
			<p>The Burrows Library is one of the town's oldest buildings behind Town Hall, being the second place built once the town was established years ago. Rumor has it that the reason for this is because the founding men and women of the town had important texts that were at risk of ruin due to unpredictable weather at the time and a vote led to the library being built next, people sleeping in the Town Hall during construction. Claire Holmes works here as one of the librarians.</p>

			<h2>Abandoned Mansion</h2>
			<p>This is an old manor that some rumored belonged to rich noble family in the past. However, the reason for it's abandonment is lost to time, leaving behind an empty manor that is slowly crumbling day by day. People rarely go near it, the building considered condemned and the mayor having banned anyone from going near it for saftey.</p> <p class="hidden">Not that it stopped anyone.</p>
