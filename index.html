	<p class="letter">Hello! Welcome to my Banned From Baker Street. My name is Claire Holmes. Despite my last name, I'm not related to the fabled Sherlock Holmes. Someone in my family just loved the name and changed it to Holmes. However, it did work out for me granted what I have been up to as of late. Since you are here, I'm sure you are curious what this is about. Well, in the town I live in, Hunters' Burrow, they have a ban on any books about Sherlock Holmes. It's very odd. Other mystery books are allowed, yet Sherlock Holmes, any version of him in written form is banned. My hope with this page is the chronicle my attempts to collect as many Sherlock Holmes related books as I can on my shelf. This room is in a secret space in my house, so don't worry about me being found out any time soon. Right now, there are no books on the shelves since...I will admit this is a recent decesion I have come to.... Anyway, there should be a book on the shelf soon. I have a good lead, but I have to be careful. For now, be safe, fellow Sherlockians.</p>
